It implements a simple number guessing game. It sets a random number between 1 and 100, and allows the user to input a guess. The script then compares the user's guess to the random number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The script also keeps track of the user's previous guesses, and ends the game if the user guesses correctly or exceeds the maximum number of allowed guesses. The script also provides a button to start a new game after the current game has ended. The script makes use of various DOM manipulation methods and event listeners to create an interactive user experience.
